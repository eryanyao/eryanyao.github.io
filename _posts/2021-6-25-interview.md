This post is use for record how to improve interview skill and how to sell yourself to the company that you hope to join. Yesterday, I went through a failed interview, i dont prepare anything before the interview. Therefore, i gain the experience from that interview and know that everything need to prepare before. A timeline is necessary. From introduction yourself until present the project. As first, we need to know what the company want.
